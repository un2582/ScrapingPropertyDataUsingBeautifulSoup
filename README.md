# ScrapingPropertyDataUsingBeautifulSoup
Created a Python script for scraping data off of a cached website. It is capable of crawling through multiple pages and grabbing the information such as property price, the utilities it has, lot size, etc.
Converts data into a csv file and also displays it in a neat data frame using pandas
The webscraping itself is done by importing the requests library as well as BeautifulSoup
Note: I ran the code in jupyter note book
The output.csv is the csv file I saved the data frame to
